# fin_ratio_calc
Python script that scrapes online financial statements and calculates 5 key ratios. I built this as a first project to start learning Python, as well as Pandas and BeautifulSoup libraries.

The script accepts one additonal command line argument: the ticker of the stock you wish to see ratios for. For example, to see information for Apple, Inc. you would enter: 

$ python fin_ratio_calc.py aapl
